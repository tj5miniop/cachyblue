- CachyOS's optimizations on Silverblues rock solid base!

This project is a modification of the 'main' and 'hwe' images created by the Universal Blue project. This takes these base projects further by adding a custom kernel (Courtesy of CachyOS), installing a tweaked version of the mutter window manager which includes tweaks for performance, as well as installing and correctly configuring NVIDIA GPU Drivers (with wayland modesetting and other performance improvements)
